As of today, the [Clang 20](https://releases.llvm.org/20.1.0/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html)/[LLVM 20](https://releases.llvm.org/20.1.0/docs/ReleaseNotes.html) toolchain is available in the CHERIoT devcontainer.
This follows on the heels of our recent releases of [Clang 18](https://releases.llvm.org/18.1.0/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html)/[LLVM 18](https://releases.llvm.org/18.1.0/docs/ReleaseNotes.html) and [Clang 19](https://releases.llvm.org/19.1.0/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html)/[LLVM 19](https://releases.llvm.org/19.1.0/docs/ReleaseNotes.html) in recent months.

With this release, we are now caught up to the most recent upstream Clang release.Going forward, we will be continuously tracking upstream Clang development in a `cheriot-upstream` branch within the [toolchain repository](https://github.com/cherIoT-Platform/llvm-project), and we will release new major versions to CHERIoT developers as they are released upstream as well.
